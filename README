Hi!

pyglet, the cross-platform windowing and multimedia library for Python and avbin, the video decoding library based on ffmpeg that is used by pyglet are great! They made developing multimedia applications so much more fun for me! Yay to Alex Holkner for creating both of them.

What I am trying to do in this fork here is to improve pyglet's video decoding and video frame rendering performance. I will try different approaches to see which strategy works best and does integrate well with pyglet's code base.

The goal is to smoothly play back 1080p Mpeg 4 video clips on a Core 2 Duo machine with about 2 GHz and onboard graphics. I wil use an OpenGL fragment shader to let the GPU perform the color space conversion from YUV to RGB.
